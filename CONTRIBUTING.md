## Open-source, not open-contribution (yet!)

[Similar to SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html) and to
[Litestream](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream) (from whom I took
inspiration for this text), runj is open source but not yet open to code
contributions.

I am using this project to get a deeper understanding of FreeBSD, the OCI
specifications, and containerd.  I learn best by reading and doing, so I
prefer to write the code myself, at least for now.

I am grateful for community involvement, bug reports, pointers in what to learn,
and feature requests.  I do not wish to come off as anything but welcoming,
however, I've made the decision to keep this project more tightly held for my 
own learning at this point.

When I have reached my own goals for learning, I plan to open runj up for code
contribution.  In the meantime, please try runj out and let me know if you learn
something interesting yourself!
